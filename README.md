ATS (Arbitrary Task Solver) is a Python library for solving variational problems. With ATS, you can efficiently solve a wide range of variational problems in the simplest and most user-friendly interface possible

One of the key advantages of ATS is the ability to solve variational problems both symbolically, i.e. analytically, and numerically using proprietary methods, which allows you to quickly and accurately model complex processes in various fields of science and engineering.

ATS has a simple interface, making it an excellent tool for researchers, engineers, and programmers working with variational problems and modeling.
